some commands we are using du -sm *|sort -n | tail 
			   du -sm *|sort -n | head
df -h .
df -k .

find /logs/ -type f -mtime +7 -exec tar -czf olderlogs.tar.gz {} \;

find /var/dtpdev/tmp/ -type f -mtime +15 ===> purpose of this command is how much space is occupy the largest files it shows .

df -h .====> how much space is occupies the /opt base file system.

19. i will deleted the files on 

1. /opt/WASupdates/tmp
2. /opt/rcm/dashtmp/cache/cSveKoh7Ug_5sBd81xpK49H
